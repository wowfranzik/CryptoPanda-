# CryptoPanda

This browser game was developed as the first project of Ironhack Web Dev bootcamp (precisely after two weeks from the beginning of the course). 

GAME IDEA GENESIS

As I'm passionate about blockchain, all my friends keep asking me "should I invest in cryptocurrencies?" . 
My answer is always "Do you have any idea of what they are and how they work?" 
and usually the answer is "nope". 

As finding relevant and understandble information on blockchain is not so easy, I've decided to create a cute 
investment advisor (a Panda) to help you test your knowledge before investing your money.

The game is a test based on true/false statements.
Your goal is to chose the right answer and collect as much pandaCoin as possible (instead of shitCoins).

I worked with jQuery DOM manipulation methods to manage the events in the game. 

Additional features will be:
- sound design;
- different levels of complexity.
